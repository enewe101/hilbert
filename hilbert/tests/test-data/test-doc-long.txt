real madrid fielded a second-string team but still won 2-1 wednesday at fc porto to become the first club to advance to the quarterfinals of this season 's champions league . real , winner of all four of its second-phase games so far , has 12 points in group c. porto stayed winless and has one . in the other group game , panathinaikos beat sparta prague 2-1 to stay second . meanwhile , deportivo moved to the top of group d with a 2-0 win over juventus in spain . arsenal beat german league leader bayer leverkusen 4-1 at highbury to stay second , level on points with deportivo . juventus and bayer leverkusen both have four points . madrid traveled to northern portugal without four key players _ luis figo has an ankle injury while coach vicente del bosque opted to rest zinedine zidane , roberto carlos and raul _ and left fernando morientes and michel salgado on the bench . argentine midfielder santiago solari scored with a header after seven minutes when madrid caught the home defense off-guard . while porto 's clumsy finishing prevented it from capitalizing on its early pressure , real madrid provided a lesson in clinical scoring as ivan helguera prodded in a loose ball from short range to make it 2-0 after 20 minutes . helder postiga embarked on a solo run in the 28th minute and passed inside for unmarked nuno capucho to score porto 's first goal in four champions league games and the club 's 300th goal in european competition . in athens , michalis constantinou scored twice as panathinaikos beat sparta prague 2-1 to boost its chances of reaching the quarterfinals . the greek club beat sparta 2-0 in prague last week . constantinou put panathinaikos ahead in the 14th minute off a long center pass from jan michaelsen . the cypriot striker , who also scored in prague , dribbled past two defenders before beating keeper petr cech . two minutes into the second period , michaelsen again fed constantinou , who headed in his fifth goal in 10 european matches . the visitors fought hard for a consolation goal , and substitute martin klein pulled one back with a header in the 89th . in london , arsenal 's french legion starred with robert pires , thierry henry and patrick vieira all scoring in the gunners ' 4-1 win over bayer leverkusen . dutchman dennis bergkamp added the last goal with a spectacular lob to give arsenal its seventh consecutive win at highbury in the champions league . zoltan sebescen scored a consolation goal for leverkusen in the 86th minute . arsenal was two goals up within the first seven minutes . five minutes in , vieira won the ball and fed pires on the left . pires , who scored in the 1-1 tie in leverkusen last tuesday , ran unchallenged to the edge of the box and cut inside to score . two minutes later , bergkamp cut through the leverkusen defense to gather a loose ball on the halfway line , and after running toward the leverkusen goal , slid to sylvain wiltord , who then crossed for an unmarked henry to score his 28th goal of the season . vieira scored three minutes into the second half , diving to head home henry 's curling free-kick after michael ballack fouled lee dixon . leverkusen was a shadow of the side that beat borussia dortmund 4-0 on the weekend to jump to the top of the bundesliga . in spain , deportivo de la coruna gave a commanding display to beat a disappointing juventus 2-0 . in an encounter which saw juventus substitute edgar davids dismissed after the interval , headed goals in each half by striker diego tristan and second-half substitute djalminha gave the spanish side a deserved win . juventus remains without a victory in spain since the 1970-71 season and without a champions league away win since march 1998 , 14 matches ago . deportivo got the reward for its early enterprise in the eighth minute when tristan beat defender ciro ferrara to head home a cross by juan valeron . it was the spanish international 's fifth goal in this season 's champions league . juventus ' hopes of drawing level suffered a crucial blow in the 73rd minute when davids was sent off for his repeated protests over swedish referee anders frisk 's decision not to award a free kick . deportivo ensured it took three points in the 77th minute when brazilian substitute djalminha met a cross from the right by international midfielder sergio gonzalez to head powerfully home . on tuesday , ole gunnar solksjaer celebrated his 29th birthday by scoring two goals tuesday as manchester united beat nantes 5-1 . galatasaray kept its three-year home unbeaten streak alive with a 1-1 draw against liverpool ; as roma got three late goals to beat fc barcelona 3-0 ; and defending champion bayern munich edged boavista 1-0 . thursday , eight uefa cup second-leg , fourth-round ties are scheduled to be played .
u.s. president bill clinton today called on congress to ask the states to adopt zero tolerance laws to combat teenaged drunk-driving . `` drunk driving , especially by young people , is one of the most serious and one of the most avoidable threats to public health in america , '' clinton said in his weekly radio address . the president cited statistics that showed one person is killed in a drunk driving-related accident every 30 minutes and one is injured in such an accident every 26 seconds . clinton said , `` congress should make zero tolerance the law of the land . '' `` if it 's illegal for people under 21 to drink at all , it should certainly be illegal for for them to drink and drive , '' he said . to date , 24 states and the district of columbia have zero tolerance laws and eight states have adopted less-stringent laws to discourage underage drinking among drivers .
a siberian tiger named duoduo died after eating rotten frozen meat several days ago , and another , meimei , is still in coma after more than ten days of treatment . the two tigers , both female , were taken to the zoo in shenyang in northeast china 's liaoning province from harbin in the nearby province of heilongjiang , where two veterinarians determined that the tigers fell ill from eating the rotten meat . the two tigers , both in their twenties , old age for siberian tigers , were vulnerable to diseases , and the cold conditions in their cages worsened their conditions . zookeepers said that they had bought 800 kilograms of meat for the animals before the chinese lunar new year on february 5 , and the long storage period caused the meat to rot and the tigers developed diarrhea and vomiting on february 10 . many local people called and visited the tigers during this period , trying to help them get through the critical period . siberian tigers are among the top-ten most endangered species in the world , with only around 300 remaining in the wild . the shenyang zoo has bred and raised 13 siberian tigers , and the first tiger cesarean birth at the zoo gained great attention nationwide .
european stocks ended another turbulent session little changed on tuesday after soothing remarks from federal reserve chairman alan greenspan led to a revival in wall street 's fortunes and helped european issues claw back earlier losses . nonetheless , many analysts were sceptical the recovery would last and warned stocks would most likely remain weighed down by a plethora of concerns ranging from the integrity of corporate america to the impact of a rapidly weakening dollar . the pan-euro zone euro stoxx 50 index was virtually flat at 2,708.1 points . the british ftse 100 index rose 0.7 percent to 4,021.9 points , having closed at its lowest level since december 1996 on monday . the german dax 30 index jumped 1.2 percent to 3,959.6 points , while the french cac 40 index fell 0.2 percent to 3,317.8 points , having closed at its lowest level since october 1998 the previous day . in new york , the dow jones industrials fell 0.5 percent to 8,594.2 points -- off an earlier low of 8,406.5 points -- while the nasdaq composite index climbed 1.5 percent . stocks were under the hammer earlier in asia where tokyo shares shed 1.2 percent while hong kong stocks gave up 1.5 percent . `` i think you can attribute the rebound to greenspan , '' said barclays stockbrokers strategist henk potts . `` the markets were particularly encouraged by his decision to raise his growth forecast for gdp ( gross domestic product ) , '' potts told greenspan said the us economy was set to emerge from a welter of corporate crimes with better-than-anticipated growth of 3.5 to 3.75 percent this year . just five months earlier , the federal reserve had forecast 2.5 to 3.0 percent growth . potts said encouraging figures from merrill lynch and general motors had helped underpin the recovery . `` it 's telling us it 's not all doom and gloom out there for a change , and quite frankly that 's all we 've been hearing day after day for a while now , '' potts said . there was some supportive news on the earnings front from dutch electronics giant philips , whose share price rose 1.3 percent to 23.50 euros as its second-quarter results got the thumbs up from investors . the group announced a loss of 1.355 billion euros ( dollarsjblargely owing to a one-off charge of 1.516 billion related to the fall in the value of its 3.5-percent stake in french media group vivendi universal . stripping out this and other exceptional charges , philips made a profit of 171 million euros , above analyst expectations . `` those looked pretty good . if we get everybody else doing something pretty similar , then things are going to turn around , but i do n't think that 's very likely , '' said bnp paribas equity strategist david thwaites . among the main losers in europe , drugs companies were under pressure again . shares in british giant glaxosmitkline managed to pare earlier losses to close 2.4 percent down at 1,147 pence . the slide followed negative broker comment after swiss pharmaceutical group novartis announced monday it would launch amoxicillin , a generic version of glaxo 's augmentin antibiotic in the us . but one winner was p and o princess cruises . its shares surged by 10.5 percent to 390 pence on reports that the european commission was likely to clear a proposed takeover of british cruise operator by us rival carnival . p and o princess has rebuffed the offer , choosing to pursue a merger of equals with miami-based royal caribbean instead . shares in deutsche telekom firmed 4.97 percent to 10.99 euros after embattled chairman ron sommer resigned . his decision followed pressure from the german government which still holds a 43-percent stake in the former state-owned monopoly . and shares in daimler-chrysler climbed 3.6 percent to 45.26 euros on rumours the auto giant was poised to raise its profit forecast for this year when it released results on thursday .
president clinton monday offered to increase aid to yasser arafat 's palestinian authority fivefold next year , to $ 500 million , while european donors pledged billions more . the total of more than $ 3 billion exceeds the goal set by the clinton administration for the palestinians . speaking at the end of monday 's donor meeting , secretary of state madeleine albright cautioned that the sum was not exact , `` but it appears that delegations pledged more than $ 3 billion today . '' the money , first promised by clinton during negotiations in october over the wye memorandum , is to improve education , modernize the palestinian legal system and build projects to create jobs on the west bank and in gaza . `` no peace stands a chance of lasting if it does not deliver real results to ordinary people , '' clinton said at the opening of the hastily-arranged , day-long meeting . as clinton called on other countries to donate generously to the palestinians , washington privately implored arafat to tone down his remarks about israel , according to interest groups that follow the mideast . specifically , they said , clinton aides urged arafat to stop making declarations that he will create an independent state next year . at monday 's conference with 50 european and asian donors and international lending groups , arafat charged that israel had intentionally hurt the palestinian economy . he stopped short of repeating comments he had made on sunday about creating an independent state . but in a message delivered at the united nations to the annual international day of solidarity with the palestinian people , arafat asked for support `` to make a reality of the declaration of independence and to implement it on the blessed soil of palestine during the coming year . '' clinton 's pledge to increase aid must be approved by congress , and the plan will face pointed opposition if arafat continues to call for statehood . senator joseph i. lieberman , a connecticut democrat who supports the peace process , said that members of congress are likely to support more aid to the palestinians `` but it wo n't be unconditional . '' arafat 's comment about statehood `` hurt the palestinians ' cause in congress because it goes against the mood and the substance of the wye agreements , which prohibit either side from taking unilateral steps , '' lieberman said in an interview last night . jon kyle , an arizona republican who serves on the senate foreign relations committee , has already threatened to cut off aid for palestinians if arafat angers benjamin netanyahu 's government in israel or complains about a plan to relocate the us embassy in israel to jerusalem . with members of congress still scrambling for committee assignments , it is too early to know who will control foreign aid appropriations next year . but at issue is role that hardliners on capitol hill will play in the process . `` every time chairman arafat talks prematurely about statehood , it erodes support in the jewish communty for his cause , '' said jason isaacson , washington representative for the american jewish committee , an influential jewish group . `` while there is widespread support for the peace process in the jewish community , there is little if any support for premature declarations of sovereignty that would undercut the process . '' a representative of the american-israel public affairs committee , one of the most important jewish groups in washington , added that it is likely to support the increased aid providing it goes to private palestinian groups , not the palestinian authority . clinton 's offer to increase aid from $ 100 million to $ 500 million came as the white house finished plans for a three-day , mid-december visit to israel , the west bank and gaza _ the first trip to palestinian-controlled areas by an american president . clinton will address the palestinian national council , which is scheduled to amend its charter and drop controversial wording calling for the destruction of israel . arafat 's visit stirred controversy because of his remarks about statehood and because of a london times report that the palestinian authority had used $ 20 million in housing aid from european governments to construct luxury apartments for arafat 's `` acolytes '' instead of for the poor . arafat made no references to the allegations , saying simply that palestinians had suffered from `` momentous constraints '' during five years of economic decline in the west bank and gaza . monday afternoon , norwegian foreign minister knut vollebaek said that israel 's restrictions on people and goods leaving the west bank and gaza since 1993 had caused a loss of more than $ 3 billion to the palestinian economy . during monday 's conference , the european union pledged about $ 480 million over the next five years and japan promised $ 200 million as several countries responded at short notice to clinton 's appeal to help keep the fragile peace process on track . us officials said that norway promised $ 170 million , saudi arabia $ 100 million , kuwait $ 80 million and canada $ 30 million . the pledges of financial support do not always materialize . five years ago , washington promised the palestinians $ 100 million a year , but it has actually sent about $ 75 million a year . albright added that the increased aid to the palestinians marks `` the beginning of a process which will turn words on paper into contracts , construction sites and commerce in the west bank and gaza and throughout the middle east . . the dividents of peace will become increasingly tangible and enduring in the lives of the palestinian people .

shells slammed into the un-declared bihac town safe area monday afternoon shortly after bosnian government troops launched an attack on nearby serb lines , the un protection force reported here . two artillery shells and a suspected tank shell struck the centre of the northwest bosnian town , damaging buildings but causing no casualties , unprofor reported . the shelling came within 20 minutes of a bosnian army infantry assault on high ground held by breakaway bosnian serbs to the east of the town . lieutenant-colonel gary coward said the 5th corps battalion-level attack , believed to involve some 400 men , struck out of the safe area towards the grabez plateau . it was not immediately known whether the moslem-led government forces had gained any ground . earlier this month , 5th corps gained a little ground to the southwest of bihac town , according to un reports here . sarajevo radio reported fighting in the northeast of the country monday , notably west of zvornik where it said government forces had repulsed three serb attacks , destroying one tank .
by john brademas and fritz heimann c. 1998 foreign affairs magazine ( distributed by new york times special features ) after years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy , cynicism and denial , corruption is becoming a target of serious international action . where once they looked the other way , the world bank , international monetary fund ( imf ) and other global organizations are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices . these expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most significant achievement to date is the convention on combating bribery of foreign public officials of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) . the convention , signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification by the legislatures of 34 nations , will end the competitively damaging isolation of the united states , which banned bribing foreign public officials in 1977 . bribery scandals in half a dozen countries led the united states to pass the foreign corrupt practices act in hopes that other countries would follow suit . but the act was derided as misguided american moralism , and foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial orders . many countries , including germany and france , even allowed their deduction as business expenses . the united states also promoted a u.n. treaty to ban bribery , but that effort fizzled . the developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity to bash multinational companies . conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic of human behavior that , in any event , was not of debilitating proportions in the developed world . although admittedly widespread in the third world , endemic corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such as indonesia , south korea , malaysia and thailand . some economists even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in overregulated societies . during the last six years , however , there has been a dramatic change in the tolerance of corruption . a wave of bribery scandals hit all parts of the world . in asia , the downfall of indonesian president suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to undertake reforms , especially regarding his family 's ill-gotten billions from state-connected enterprises . corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of prime ministers p.v. narasimha rao of india and benazir bhutto of pakistan . in south korea , former presidents roh tae woo and chun doo hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received enormous bribes from korean companies . in japan , numerous top-level government and business leaders have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals . in latin america , bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of presidents fernando collor de mello of brazil and carlos andres perez of venezuela , as well as the resignation of president abdala bucaram of ecuador . in mexico , president carlos salinas de gortari was tarnished by his brother 's illicit accumulation of huge sums . president ernesto samper of colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money from the cali drug cartel , but his political authority was eroded and his party lost the recent presidential election . in italy , the bribery charges brought by milanese magistrates have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled italy for more than four decades . the defeat of prime minister felipe gonzalez of spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his cabinet . bribery charges also caused the resignation of nato secretary-general willy claes , a former belgian defense minister , and of czech prime minister vaclav klaus . last year 's overthrow of zairean president mobutu sese seko was fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption . in china , a member of the politburo resigned in a massive corruption scandal . the foregoing , while far from complete , demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon . the growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence of several political and economic pressures . the post-cold war era has brought an opening up of governmental processes , freer news coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges . corruption is harder to hide , as the wave of bribery scandals involving high-level officials in europe , asia and south america demonstrates . on the economic front , impediments to investment and other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in russia , africa and eastern europe . with the growth of the global economy , international business leaders are increasingly recognizing that common , morally defensible rules are essential . most important , people have recognized that corruption is a major obstacle to democratic transitions , market economies and development . citizens are using protests , elections and agencies of civil society to press for reform . until recently , the world bank and other international financing agencies paid little heed to corruption , apparently considering it a political matter outside their purview . at the bank , this attitude began to change with the appointment of james wolfensohn as president in 1995 . his speech at that year 's annual meeting included the first reference to corruption in a presidential address . at the 1996 meeting , wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority . he invited transparency international _ an anticorruption organization that in five years has established chapters in more than 70 countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country by country _ to help develop the bank 's anticorruption strategy . in 1997 , the bank adopted a comprehensive program , including strong controls to prevent bribery on world bank-financed projects and assistance to governments to promote reforms . similar changes are taking place at other international financing agencies . the imf , going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and fiscal policy , is emphasizing the need for transparency and other steps to curb corruption . the inter-american , european and asian development banks are following the world bank 's lead in adopting stricter controls over projects they finance . and the global coalition for africa has made combating corruption its most important priority for 1998 . the inter-american convention against corruption was adopted in march 1996 . it has been signed by 26 countries , but ratified by only 10 . momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled . congressional renewal of the fast-track authority needed by the executive branch to negotiate trade treaties could reignite interest . establishment by the organization of american states of a body similar to the oecd 's anti-bribery working group to provide professional support and monitor progress by western hemisphere governments would also be helpful . the international chamber of commerce in paris is playing an important role in encouraging the global business community to become active in fighting corruption . the chamber 's focus is on improving corporate self-regulation programs . strong `` rules of conduct to combat extortion and bribery , '' prepared by a group of lawyers , managers , and scholars from over a dozen countries , were issued in 1996 . the rules deal forthrightly with such issues as payments to sales agents and other intermediaries , business entertainment and gifts , and political contributions . they cover not only bribery of public officials but bribery within the private sector as well . the chamber is preparing a manual to assist companies in complying with the rules and with the oecd principles . this , along with greater use of corporate rules of conduct , will reduce the supply side of international corruption . the demand side _ extortion and other forms of corruption by public officials _ is more difficult to target effectively . every country has laws prohibiting its officials from taking bribes , but such laws are unlikely to be enforced when top officials are corrupt . the world bank , imf , transparency international and others are working on programs to promote greater transparency in government operations and other measures to combat demand-side abuses . by curbing foreign bribery , industrialized countries will increase the credibility in the developing world of their proposals for combating demand-side corruption . the developments of the last five years , although remarkable , are only the start of a long , difficult effort . although there is widespread support for action against corruption , entrenched groups oppose reforms . corruption has powerful beneficiaries : officials in high places , companies with large resources and a legion of influential middlemen . wherever corruption has become a way of life , wholesale change is necessary . tossing out a few rotten apples will not be enough . during the last five years , the argument that the costs of corruption are intolerable has been winning . the biggest challenge for the next five years is to assure continued public support by showing tangible results . many factors contribute to the pressure for accountability in the post-cold war world : the spread of investigative journalism , opposition parties anxious to expose corrupt ruling parties , more independent prosecutors and judges , whistle-blower protection , the growth of the corporate governance movement and the expansion of the global economy with increased demand for international accounting standards . these developments bolster the movement to curb corruption and enhance the prospects for achieving lasting reforms . ( john brademas is president emeritus of new york university , chairman of the national endowment for democracy and a member of transparency international 's international advisory council . fritz heimann is counselor to the general counsel , general electric co. . he is a founding member and director of transparency international . )
an australian journalist on monday denied criticising the singapore judiciary , saying the state was not on his mind when he edited a political commentary the government claims scandalised local courts . michael richardson , asia editor of the paris-based international herald tribune ( iht ) , told the high court he had countries like china in mind when he edited and recommended publication of the commentary by american academic christopher lingle . attorney-general chan sek keong has asked the court to punish richardson and lingle for the commentary which appeared in the iht 's october 7 issue on the ground that it amounts to contempt of court . lingle said in his commentary that some `` intolerant regimes '' in the region had shown considerable ingenuity in suppressing dissent including `` relying upon a compliant judiciary to bankrupt opposition politicians . '' chan told the court on january 9 , when the hearing began , that although lingle did not name singapore , the reference was clear because everyone knew government politicians in singapore sue opposition politicians for defamation whenever the occasion arose . also cited for contempt are the iht publisher and chief executive richard mcclean , the international herald tribune ( singapore ) which distributes the paper and the singapore press holdings ltd , the iht 's local printer . lingle , 46 , a senior fellow at the national univeristy of singapore when he wrote the commentary , left for the united states after being questioned by police . he has not returned for the trial and is not represented in court . `` it did not occur to me that the passage could refer to singapore or the singapore courts , '' richardson said in an affidavit filed with the court . `` i thought that the reference to a compliant judiciary was a reference to the judiciary in asian communist and military regimes such as china , burma , vietnam and north korea where there is no effective separation between the executive and the judiciary , '' he said in the document . richardson said to intense questioning by chan that he viewed singapore as a `` multi-party democracy , '' arguing that he saw lingle 's use of the word `` regimes '' as a reference to governments that were totalitarian . `` the asian communist or military governemnts fall into this category , '' he said , denying a suggestion by chan that `` regimes '' could also describe democracies . shown an article by lingle published last month in which the academic used the word `` regime '' in a wider context to include singapore , richardson said that piece was written by someone obviously `` unhappy '' and `` embittered . '' in the article published december 2 , lingle referred to `` singapore and several other east asian regimes , '' saying political elites in these `` leninists one-party states '' decided what was best for the people . `` singapore is not a leninist state , nor is it a one-party state . it is common knowledge that opposition parties operate in singapore , contest elections . indeed there are some opposition mps , '' he said . the iht published a `` clarification '' in its december 10-11 edition in which it unreservedly apologised to former prime minister lee kuan yew and the judiciary for lingle 's october 7 article . richardson said in his affidavit he had no intention of impugning or questioning the independence , integrity or impartality of the singapore judiciary . but he said if the court thought the lingle commentary referred to singapore `` then i associate myself with the statement published in the international herald tribue on 10 december 1994 and offer my unreserved and unqualified apology to this honourable court .

i marked the end of summer with the help of a fine automobile . other people have their talismans . cars are mine . and this one , the 1997 jaguar xk8 convertible , was particularly beautiful . it was as sleek and muscular as its animal namesake -- and as sensuous , too . it was forest green with an interior of tan connolly leather and burl walnut wood . it had a padded , tan canvas top , which would raise and lower itself at the push of a button . i enjoyed every moment in the xk8 . background : jaguar is essential in the way that art is essential . it is of limited utilitarian value . that is , there are numerous other cars that can do what it does on the road at substantially lower prices . but the world would be poorer for jaguar 's absence , just as it would be impoverished by the absence of paintings , sculpture , music , theater , dance and literature . food and water sustain the body . these things sustain the soul . that is jaguar 's excuse for being : it is car as art -- high art -- and as long as it remains true to that mission , it always will have a place in the market . certainly that is the case with the new xk8 , which replaces the jaguar xjs . available as a hardtop or the tested convertible , the xk8 is jaguar 's first all-new sports car in 21 years . that 's `` new '' in terms of technology , such as the much more reliable multiplex electronics system that eliminates the cumbersome and often faultily connected wiring harnesses of bygone jaguars . but it 's not `` new '' in terms of spirit . if anything , the xk8 confirms jaguar 's return to the stylistic path from which it strayed in its 1980s pursuit of yuppiedom . this car -- unlike those ill-begotten , square-butt , square-faced models of the past decade -- is a classic beauty . it is romantic . it makes the heart leap . it bespeaks poetry as eloquently as it does wealth . of course , it helps that jaguar , under the auspices of its current owner , ford motor co. , has greatly improved product quality . for example , buyers of the xk8 will note that it is lighter , tighter and far more nimble than its xjs predecessor . and with the top up on the convertible , they will note that the xk8 is much quieter than the xjs . nary a squeak , rattle or shimmy in the new one . that extra rigidity and lightness was achieved through the use of more high-strength steel and lightweight metals , such as aluminum ; and by manufacturing techniques such as adding cross-bracing under the engine bay and stiffening members in the door sills and windshield frame . there are other changes , perhaps the most notable of which is the xk8 's aj ( all jaguar ) v-8 engine , jaguar 's first v-8 . it is an all-aluminum , 4-liter , 32-valve , double overhead-cam engine rated 290 horsepower at 6,100 rpm with torque rated 280-pound-feet at 4,200 rpm . it 's a whizzer ! an electronically controlled , five-speed automatic transmission is standard on the xk8 convertible and coupe . standard brakes include vacuum-assisted four-wheel anti-lock discs , vented front and rear . the xk8 runs on 17-inch pirelli p-zero radials . both the convertible and the coupe are front-engine , rear-wheel-drive cars that purport to seat four people-albeit only two of them ( the front occupants ) comfortably . complaints : the usual on sports cars of this type-totally useless rear `` seats . '' praise : a simply beautiful , well-engineered car . head-turning quotient : the xk8 is princess di and tina turner rolled into an automobile . stunning beauty and sensuality . ride , acceleration and handling : oh , it does all of those things quite competently , especially in handling and acceleration ( 0-to-60 mph in 6.7 seconds ) . but anyone focusing on that misses the point of the xk8 . it 's a parade piece , a stuff-struttin ' flirtmobile . it 's essential picasso -- a total renunciation of anything that smacks of celibacy . and it brakes well . mileage : about 21 to the gallon ( 19.9-gallon tank , estimated 407-mile range on usable volume of required premium unleaded ) , combined city-highway , running with one to two occupants and light cargo in a trunk ( 11.1 cubic feet ) that could carry only light cargo . sound system : harman kardon with trunk-mounted cd changer . superb . price : base price on the xk8 convertible is $ 69,900 . estimated dealer invoice on base model is $ 58,900 . price as tested is $ 76,280 including $ 5,800 in options ( all-weather package , premium sound system with trunk-mounted cd changer , chrome wheels and special paint job ) , and a $ 580 transportation charge . purse-strings note : an estimated 12,000 xk8 models will be sold worldwide for model-year 1997 . the likelihood is that most dealers are n't going to be willing to deal on this high-demand luxcar .
